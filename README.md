# Horseback riding

This website provides information for those who would like to go for both shorter and longer horseback rides out in the wilderness. 
 

## UX

I created this website to let people (both beginners and advanced riders), who want to go for horseback riding, have the opportunity to read about trails and horses. The webpage owner can easily get contacted to book a trailride (when the modal works). 

### User stories
- As a family we would like to go far out in the nature without our car. 
- As Wilma is new to horses she would like to go for a shorter ride to try it out.
- As Sven like the wildlife he would appreciate a few days out in nature from horseback to experience the wildlife at its best.


## Features
 
### Existing Features
- "Landing page/home page" allows users to see pictures of the trails avaiable (the Bootstrap carousel).  
- "About" page allows visitors to know more about the webpage owner. 
- "Trails" page allows users to read about available trailrides.
- "Contact" page allows users to contact the webpage owner by filling out the form.
- All pages allows users to navigate to the other pages by the navbar.
- Visit social media via the links in the footer.

### Features Left to Implement
- Present the horses available for the trailrides under a page called "Horses". 
- Accommodation: at site or hotels near by. 
- Price-lists


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): for the navbar toggler, carousel, modal and responsiveness.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): for icons in the footer
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): to use the Roboto font


## Testing

The modal (contact page) is not working perfect due to lack of Javascript skills, but this is something I would like to change once I have the Javascript skills to do so. The email is set to required, and that is not working at the moment.

The code have been validated in a [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) respectively.

Different web-browsers (Opera, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Chrome) have been used to check the website's layout and that the site works well on different devices.
