# Horseback riding

A website for those who would like to go for both shorter and longer rides out in the wilderness. 

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
### User stories
- As a family we would like to go far out in the nature without our car. 

- As Wilma is new to horses she would like to go for a shorter ride to try it out.

- As Sven like the wildlife he would appreciate a few days out in nature from horseback to experience the wildlife at its best.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- "Landing page" allows users to see pictures of the trails avaiable (via the Bootstrap carousel).  
- "About" page allows visitors to know more about the webpage owner. 
- "Trails" page allows users to know about available trailrides.
- "Contact" page allows users to contact the webpage owner by filling out the form.
- All pages allows users to navigate to the other pages by the navbar. Also visit social media via the links in the footer.

### Features Left to Implement
- Present the horses available for the trailrides under a page called "Horses". 
- Accommodation: at site or hotels near by. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): for the navbar, content sections and responsiveness.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): for icons in the footer
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): to use the Roboto font

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
